[LAN + (Raspberry Pi || PC)] Domicile -> Command & Control Server including an embedded web server that exposes controls for the user to interact with the hardware devices.

Potential middleman application
[Wifi + (Raspberry Pi || Arduino)] 

[Wifi + Arduino] Hardware Device -> A simple device that interfaces with a 3rd-party hardware device that can control a multitude of different appliances. From lamps to heat, from television to radio.


TEST SETUP:
Domicile Server on PC/Laptop, but hopefully on Raspberry Pi
Arduino using serial COM ports to emulate network usage with a simple LED to change colors.
